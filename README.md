# geekish/dotfiles

These are my dotfiles.
I use them on MacOS, Linux (Ubuntu Jammy), and recently, Windows & [WSL].

There's no installer or setup script (Brewfile is just for reference), I just clone this repo to `~/.dotfiles` and symlink files where they need to go.

## Using

- [zsh] with [antidote] & [Starship] prompt
- [tmux] with [tpm] and [tmuxinator]
- [Composer] for PHP
- [PowerShell] thanks to my husband
